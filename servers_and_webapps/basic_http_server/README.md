Welcome to my basic, HTTP-server-from-scratch project.

This project implements a basic HTTP server from scratch using Python, without the help of frameworks like Django or Flask.

It was a nice piece of work that allowed me to understand how HTTP servers operate "under the hood". Frameworks, while incredibly useful, take a lot of the nitty gritty out of the development process, which makes learning a little more difficult, since you cannot follow the operations of the server step-by-step as easily if it were just made from scratch.

Big shout-out to Jo√£o Ventura for creating the awesome tutorial that made this project possible. To check it out, [click here](http://joaoventura.net/blog/2017/python-webserver/).
